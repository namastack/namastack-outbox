# Database Support

## Supported Databases

Namastack Outbox supports any JPA/JDBC-compatible relational database. The JDBC module includes
automatic schema creation for the following databases:

- ✅ H2 (development)
- ✅ MySQL / MariaDB
- ✅ PostgreSQL
- ✅ SQL Server
- ✅ Oracle

### MongoDB

MongoDB is supported via the dedicated `namastack-outbox-starter-mongodb` module. Collections
and indexes are created automatically via Spring Data MongoDB on application startup. For manual
index management and index definitions, see [MongoDB Schema](mongodb-schema.md). For module
setup and configuration, see [Persistence Modules → MongoDB](persistence.md#mongodb-module).

## Schema Management

### JDBC Module — Automatic Initialization

The JDBC module creates the outbox schema automatically on application startup. This is enabled
by default and requires no additional configuration.

To **disable** automatic schema creation (recommended for production deployments that use
migration tools):

```yaml
namastack:
  outbox:
    jdbc:
      schema-initialization:
        enabled: false
```

When disabled, you are responsible for creating the schema using your preferred migration
tooling before the application starts.

### JPA Module — No Automatic Schema Creation

The JPA module does **not** support automatic schema creation. Schema management is delegated
to Hibernate or your migration tool.

**Option 1: Hibernate DDL Auto (Development Only)**

```yaml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create      # or create-drop for test environments
```

This is convenient for local development but should never be used in production — it may drop
and recreate tables on restart.

**Option 2: Flyway or Liquibase (Production)**

Create the outbox tables as part of your migration scripts. Database-specific SQL schema files
are available in the repository:
👉 [Schema Files on GitHub](https://github.com/namastack/namastack-outbox/tree/main/namastack-outbox-jdbc/src/main/resources/schema)

Then configure Hibernate to validate the schema on startup rather than modify it:

```yaml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
```

If the schema does not match the expected structure, Spring Boot will fail to start — which is
the desired behavior for production deployments.

## Migration Strategies

### Flyway

Add the Flyway migration file to `src/main/resources/db/migration/`:

```sql
-- V1__create_outbox_tables.sql
-- Copy the content from the appropriate schema file for your database
```

### Liquibase

Add the outbox table definition to your Liquibase changelog. Use the SQL schema files linked
above as the source for the `sql` changeset type, or translate to Liquibase XML/YAML format.

## Troubleshooting

**`Table 'outbox_record' doesn't exist`**
The schema has not been initialized. Either enable automatic initialization (JDBC module) or
apply the migration scripts before starting the application.

**`Schema-validation: missing table`** (JPA module)
Hibernate's `ddl-auto: validate` found a mismatch. Ensure your migration scripts match the
schema files for the current library version. Check for pending migrations.

**`Could not obtain lock on outbox partition`** (PostgreSQL)
This is a normal advisory lock contention message logged at DEBUG level when multiple instances
compete for the same partition. It is not an error — the second instance will retry on the next
poll cycle.

**Oracle: `ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object`**
Automatic schema initialization tried to create tables that already exist. Disable automatic
initialization and manage the schema manually.
