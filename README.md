# Namastack Outbox for Spring Boot

A robust Spring Boot library that implements the **Outbox Pattern** for reliable message publishing
in distributed systems ‚Äî built and maintained by [Namastack](https://outbox.namastack.io).
This library ensures that domain events are published reliably, even in the face of system failures,
by using transactional guarantees and hash-based partitioning.

## Features

- üîÑ **Transactional Outbox Pattern**: Ensures events are never lost
- üéØ **Hash-based Partitioning**: Automatic partition assignment for horizontal scaling
- üîÅ **Automatic Retry**: Multiple retry policies with configurable strategies
- üìä **Event Ordering**: Guarantees event processing order per aggregate
- ‚ö° **High Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput scenarios
- üõ°Ô∏è **Race Condition Safe**: Partition-based coordination prevents conflicts
- üìà **Horizontally Scalable**: Dynamic instance coordination and rebalancing
- üéØ **Zero Message Loss**: Database-backed reliability
- üé≤ **Jitter Support**: Randomized delays to prevent thundering herd
- üìä **Built-in Metrics**: Comprehensive monitoring with Micrometer integration

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Dependencies

Add the library to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.namastack:namastack-outbox-starter-jpa:0.2.0")
}
```

Or if you're using Maven, add to your `pom.xml`:

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.namastack</groupId>
  <artifactId>namastack-outbox-starter-jpa</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Enable Outbox

Add the `@EnableOutbox` and `@EnableScheduling` annotations to your Spring Boot application:

```kotlin
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableOutbox
@EnableScheduling  // Required for automatic event processing
class YourApplication

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    runApplication<YourApplication>(*args)
}
```

### 3. Configure Clock Bean

The library requires a Clock bean for time-based operations. Configure your own Clock, if you 
don't want to use the default Clock bean from namastack-outbox:

```kotlin
@Configuration
class OutboxConfiguration {

    @Bean
    fun clock(): Clock = Clock.systemUTC()
}
```

### 4. Configure Database

The library requires two database tables. You can enable automatic schema creation:

```yaml
outbox:
  schema-initialization:
    enabled: true
```

Or create the tables manually:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS outbox_record
(
    id            VARCHAR(255)             NOT NULL,
    status        VARCHAR(20)              NOT NULL,
    aggregate_id  VARCHAR(255)             NOT NULL,
    event_type    VARCHAR(255)             NOT NULL,
    payload       TEXT                     NOT NULL,
    created_at    TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    completed_at  TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    retry_count   INT                      NOT NULL,
    next_retry_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    partition     INTEGER                  NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS outbox_instance
(
    instance_id    VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    hostname       VARCHAR(255)             NOT NULL,
    port           INTEGER                  NOT NULL,
    status         VARCHAR(50)              NOT NULL,
    started_at     TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    last_heartbeat TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at     TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    updated_at     TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outbox_record_aggregate_created
    ON outbox_record (aggregate_id, created_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outbox_record_partition_status_retry
    ON outbox_record (partition, status, next_retry_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outbox_record_status_retry
    ON outbox_record (status, next_retry_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outbox_record_status
    ON outbox_record (status);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outbox_record_aggregate_completed_created
    ON outbox_record (aggregate_id, completed_at, created_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outbox_instance_status_heartbeat
    ON outbox_instance (status, last_heartbeat);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outbox_instance_last_heartbeat
    ON outbox_instance (last_heartbeat);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outbox_instance_status
    ON outbox_instance (status);
```

### 5. Create Event Processor

Implement `OutboxRecordProcessor` to handle your events:

```kotlin
@Component
class MyEventProcessor : OutboxRecordProcessor {

    private val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(javaClass)
    private val objectMapper = ObjectMapper()

    override fun process(record: OutboxRecord) {
        when (record.eventType) {
            "OrderCreated" -> handleOrderCreated(record)
            "OrderUpdated" -> handleOrderUpdated(record)
            "OrderCanceled" -> handleOrderCanceled(record)
            else -> logger.warn("Unknown event type: ${record.eventType}")
        }
    }

    private fun handleOrderCreated(record: OutboxRecord) {
        val event = objectMapper.readValue(record.payload, OrderCreatedEvent::class.java)
        // Publish to message broker, call external API, etc.
        messagePublisher.publish("orders.created", event)
    }
}
```

### 6. Save Events to Outbox

Inject `OutboxRecordRepository`, `Clock`, and save events using the OutboxRecord Builder:

```kotlin
@Service
class OrderService(
    private val orderRepository: OrderRepository,
    private val outboxRepository: OutboxRecordRepository,
    private val objectMapper: ObjectMapper,
    private val clock: Clock  // Inject Clock for consistent timestamps
) {

    @Transactional
    fun createOrder(command: CreateOrderCommand): Order {
        // Create and save the order
        val order = Order.create(command)
        orderRepository.save(order)

        // Save event to outbox - same transaction!
        val event = OrderCreatedEvent(order.id, order.customerId, order.amount)
        val outboxRecord = OutboxRecord.Builder()
            .aggregateId(order.id.toString())
            .eventType("OrderCreated")
            .payload(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(event))
            .build(clock)  // Pass clock for consistent timestamps

        outboxRepository.save(outboxRecord)

        return order
    }

    @Transactional
    fun updateOrder(orderId: OrderId, command: UpdateOrderCommand): Order {
        val order = orderRepository.findById(orderId)
            ?: throw OrderNotFoundException(orderId)

        order.update(command)
        orderRepository.save(order)

        // Create update event using Builder
        val event = OrderUpdatedEvent(order.id, order.customerId, order.amount)
        val outboxRecord = OutboxRecord.Builder()
            .aggregateId(order.id.toString())
            .eventType("OrderUpdated")
            .payload(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(event))
            .build(clock)

        outboxRepository.save(outboxRecord)

        return order
    }
}
```

**Alternative: Using OutboxRecord.restore() for specific field values**

For testing or when you need to specify all properties (like retry count, status, etc.), use the
`restore` method:

```kotlin
// For testing or when recreating records with specific states
val outboxRecord = OutboxRecord.restore(
    id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
    aggregateId = order.id.toString(),
    eventType = "OrderCreated",
    payload = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(event),
    partition = 1,
    createdAt = OffsetDateTime.now(clock),
    status = OutboxRecordStatus.NEW,
    completedAt = null,
    retryCount = 0,
    nextRetryAt = OffsetDateTime.now(clock)
)
```

**When to use which method:**

- **Builder**: Use for creating new events in your business logic (recommended for most cases)
- **restore()**: Use in tests or when you need to recreate records with specific field values

## Configuration

Configure the outbox behavior in your `application.yml`:

```yaml
outbox:
  # Polling interval for processing events (milliseconds)
  poll-interval: 2000
  
  # Batch size for processing events
  batch-size: 10

  # Schema initialization
  schema-initialization:
    enabled: true

  # Processing behavior configuration
  processing:
    stop-on-first-failure: true  # Stop processing aggregate when one event fails (default: true)

  # Instance coordination and partition management
  instance:
    graceful-shutdown-timeout-seconds: 15     # Timeout for graceful shutdown
    stale-instance-timeout-seconds: 30        # When to consider an instance stale
    heartbeat-interval-seconds: 5             # Heartbeat frequency
    new-instance-detection-interval-seconds: 10  # Instance discovery frequency

  # Retry configuration
  retry:
    max-retries: 3             # Maximum retry attempts (applies to all policies)
    policy: "exponential"      # Main retry policy: fixed, exponential, or jittered

    # Exponential backoff configuration
    exponential:
      initial-delay: 2000      # Start with 2 seconds
      max-delay: 60000         # Cap at 60 seconds  
      multiplier: 2.0          # Double each time

    # Fixed delay configuration
    fixed:
      delay: 5000              # Always wait 5 seconds

    # Jittered retry configuration (adds randomness to base policy)
    jittered:
      base-policy: exponential # Base policy: fixed or exponential
      jitter: 500              # Add 0-500ms random jitter
```

## Hash-based Partitioning

The library uses hash-based partitioning to enable horizontal scaling across multiple application 
instances while maintaining strict event ordering per aggregate (if activated).

### How Partitioning Works

1. **Consistent Hashing**: Each outbox record is assigned to a partition based on its `aggregateId` using MurmurHash3
2. **Fixed Partition Count**: The system uses 256 fixed partitions (configurable at compile time)
3. **Dynamic Assignment**: Partitions are automatically distributed among active instances
4. **Automatic Rebalancing**: When instances join or leave, partitions are reassigned

### Partition Assignment

```kotlin
// Each aggregate always maps to the same partition
val partition = PartitionHasher.getPartitionForAggregate("order-123")
// partition will always be the same value for "order-123"
```

### Instance Coordination

The library automatically coordinates multiple instances:

```yaml
outbox:
  instance:
    graceful-shutdown-timeout-seconds: 15     # Time to wait for graceful shutdown
    stale-instance-timeout-seconds: 30        # When to consider an instance dead
    heartbeat-interval-seconds: 5             # How often instances send heartbeats
    new-instance-detection-interval-seconds: 10  # How often to check for new instances
```

### Scaling Behavior

- **Scale Up**: New instances automatically receive partition assignments
- **Scale Down**: Partitions from stopped instances are redistributed to remaining instances
- **Load Balancing**: Partitions are distributed as evenly as possible across instances

### Example: 3 Instances with 256 Partitions

```
Instance 1: Partitions 0-84   (85 partitions)
Instance 2: Partitions 85-169 (85 partitions) 
Instance 3: Partitions 170-255 (86 partitions)
```

When Instance 2 goes down:
```
Instance 1: Partitions 0-84, 170-211   (127 partitions)
Instance 3: Partitions 85-169, 212-255 (129 partitions)
```

### Ordering Guarantees

‚úÖ **Per-Aggregate Ordering**: All events for the same aggregate are processed in order  
‚úÖ **Cross-Instance Safety**: Only one instance processes events for each aggregate  
‚úÖ **Failure Recovery**: Partitions are automatically reassigned when instances fail  
‚úÖ **No Manual Configuration**: Partition assignment is fully automatic

The library provides configurable processing behavior to handle different use cases and
requirements.

### Stop on First Failure

Control how the scheduler handles failures within an aggregate:

```yaml
outbox:
  processing:
    stop-on-first-failure: true  # Default behavior
```

**`stop-on-first-failure: true` (Default)**

- When one event fails, processing stops for the remaining events in that aggregate
- Maintains strict event ordering within aggregates
- Prevents potential cascading issues from dependent events
- Recommended when events within an aggregate have dependencies

**`stop-on-first-failure: false`**

- When one event fails, processing continues with the next events in the same aggregate
- Maximizes throughput by allowing independent events to proceed
- Failed events will be retried according to the retry policy
- Recommended when events within an aggregate are independent

**Example Use Cases:**

```yaml
# E-commerce scenario - events depend on each other
outbox:
  processing:
    stop-on-first-failure: true  # If OrderCreated fails, don't process OrderShipped
```

```yaml
# Logging/Analytics scenario - events are independent  
outbox:
  processing:
    stop-on-first-failure: false  # Continue logging other events even if one fails
```

**Behavior Impact:**

| Configuration    | Event 1   | Event 2 | Event 3    | Result                         |
|------------------|-----------|---------|------------|--------------------------------|
| `true` (default) | ‚úÖ Success | ‚ùå Fails | ‚è∏Ô∏è Skipped | Event 2 retried, Event 3 waits |
| `false`          | ‚úÖ Success | ‚ùå Fails | ‚úÖ Success  | Event 2 retried independently  |

## Retry Mechanisms

The library provides sophisticated retry mechanisms to handle transient failures gracefully.
Multiple retry policies are available to suit different use cases.

### Retry Policies

#### 1. Fixed Delay Retry Policy

Retries with a constant delay between attempts:

```yaml
outbox:
  retry:
    policy: "fixed"
    max-retries: 5
    fixed:
      delay: 5000  # Always wait 5 seconds between retries
```

**Use case**: Simple scenarios where you want consistent retry intervals.

#### 2. Exponential Backoff Retry Policy

Implements exponential backoff with configurable initial and maximum delays:

```yaml
outbox:
  retry:
    policy: "exponential"
    max-retries: 10
    exponential:
      initial-delay: 1000    # Start with 1 second
      max-delay: 300000      # Cap at 5 minutes
      multiplier: 2.0        # Backoff multiplier
```

**Retry schedule**:

- Retry 1: 1 second
- Retry 2: 2 seconds
- Retry 3: 4 seconds
- Retry 4: 8 seconds
- Retry 5: 16 seconds
- ...continues doubling until `max-delay`

**Use case**: Most common scenario - gradually back off to reduce load on failing systems.

#### 3. Jittered Retry Policy

Adds randomization to any base policy to prevent thundering herd problems:

```yaml
outbox:
  retry:
    policy: "jittered"
    max-retries: 7
    jittered:
      base-policy: exponential # Base policy: fixed or exponential
      jitter: 1000             # Add 0-1000ms random jitter
    exponential: # Configure the base policy
      initial-delay: 2000
      max-delay: 60000
      multiplier: 2.0
```

**Example with exponential base**:

- Base delay: 2 seconds ‚Üí Actual delay: 2.0-3.0 seconds
- Base delay: 4 seconds ‚Üí Actual delay: 4.0-5.0 seconds
- Base delay: 8 seconds ‚Üí Actual delay: 8.0-9.0 seconds

**Use case**: High-traffic systems where many instances might retry simultaneously.

### Custom Retry Policies

You can implement custom retry logic by creating a bean that implements `OutboxRetryPolicy`:

```kotlin
@Component
class CustomRetryPolicy : OutboxRetryPolicy {

    override fun shouldRetry(exception: Throwable): Boolean {
        // Only retry on specific exceptions
        return when (exception) {
            is HttpRetryException,
            is SocketTimeoutException,
            is ConnectException -> true
            is SecurityException -> false  // Never retry auth failures
            else -> true
        }
    }

    override fun nextDelay(retryCount: Int): Duration {
        // Custom delay logic
        return when {
            retryCount <= 2 -> Duration.ofSeconds(1)      // Quick retries first
            retryCount <= 5 -> Duration.ofSeconds(30)     // Medium delays
            else -> Duration.ofMinutes(5)                 // Longer delays for persistent failures
        }
    }
}
```

### Retry Behavior Configuration

#### Exception-Based Retry Logic

Control which exceptions should trigger retries:

```kotlin
@Component
class SelectiveRetryPolicy : OutboxRetryPolicy {

    override fun shouldRetry(exception: Throwable): Boolean {
        return when (exception) {
            // Retry transient failures
            is SocketTimeoutException,
            is HttpRetryException,
            is ConnectTimeoutException -> true

            // Don't retry business logic failures
            is ValidationException,
            is AuthenticationException,
            is IllegalArgumentException -> false

            // Default: retry unknown exceptions
            else -> true
        }
    }

    // ...existing code...
}
```

### Error Handling

The library automatically handles retries with the configured policy. Here's what happens when
processing fails:

1. **Exception Occurs**: During event processing
2. **Retry Decision**: `shouldRetry(exception)` determines if retry should happen
3. **Retry Count Check**: Verifies retry count hasn't exceeded `max-retries`
4. **Delay Calculation**: `nextDelay(retryCount)` calculates wait time
5. **Scheduling**: Event is scheduled for retry at calculated time
6. **Final Failure**: After max retries, event is marked as `FAILED`

## Metrics

The `namastack-outbox-metrics` module provides comprehensive metrics for Outbox records and 
partition distribution, integrating automatically with Micrometer and Spring Boot Actuator.

### Prerequisites

- The JPA module (`namastack-outbox-jpa`) must be included.
- Micrometer and Spring Boot Actuator must be present and configured as dependencies.
- The `@EnableOutbox` annotation must be set in your application.

### Integration

Add the metrics module to your dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.namastack:namastack-outbox-metrics:0.2.0")
}
```

Make sure the Actuator endpoints are enabled (e.g. in `application.properties`):

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health, info, metrics
```

### Available Metrics

#### Record Status Metrics

The module registers gauges for each Outbox status:

- `outbox.records.count{status="new|failed|completed"}` - Count of records by status

#### Partition Metrics

The module also provides partition-level metrics for monitoring load distribution:

- `outbox.partitions.assigned.count` - Number of partitions assigned to this instance
- `outbox.partitions.pending.records.total` - Total pending records across assigned partitions
- `outbox.partitions.pending.records.max` - Maximum pending records in any assigned partition
- `outbox.partitions.pending.records.avg` - Average pending records per assigned partition

#### Cluster Metrics

Monitor cluster-wide partition distribution:

- `outbox.cluster.instances.total` - Total number of active instances in the cluster
- `outbox.cluster.partitions.total` - Total number of partitions (always 256)
- `outbox.cluster.partitions.avg_per_instance` - Average partitions per instance

### Example: Querying Metrics

```shell
# Record status metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/outbox.records.count

# Partition metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/outbox.partitions.assigned.count
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/outbox.cluster.instances.total
```

### Prometheus Integration

If Prometheus is enabled in Spring Boot Actuator (e.g. by adding
`implementation("io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus")` and enabling the endpoint), all
Outbox metrics are available under `/actuator/prometheus`:

```
# Record metrics
outbox_records_count{status="new",...} <value>
outbox_records_count{status="failed",...} <value>
outbox_records_count{status="completed",...} <value>

# Partition metrics
outbox_partitions_assigned_count{...} <value>
outbox_partitions_pending_records_total{...} <value>
outbox_partitions_pending_records_max{...} <value>
outbox_partitions_pending_records_avg{...} <value>

# Cluster metrics
outbox_cluster_instances_total{...} <value>
outbox_cluster_partitions_total{...} <value>
outbox_cluster_partitions_avg_per_instance{...} <value>
```

### Grafana Dashboard

Use these metrics to create monitoring dashboards:

- **Load Distribution**: Monitor `outbox.partitions.pending.records.*` across instances
- **Cluster Health**: Track `outbox.cluster.instances.total` for instance failures
- **Processing Backlog**: Watch `outbox.records.count{status="new"}` for backlogs
- **Failure Rate**: Monitor `outbox.records.count{status="failed"}` for issues

## Monitoring

Monitor outbox status and partition distribution:

```kotlin
@Service
class OutboxMonitoringService(
    private val outboxRepository: OutboxRecordRepository,
    private val partitionMetricsProvider: OutboxPartitionMetricsProvider
) {

    fun getPendingEvents(): List<OutboxRecord> {
        return outboxRepository.findPendingRecords()
    }

    fun getFailedEvents(): List<OutboxRecord> {
        return outboxRepository.findFailedRecords()
    }

    fun getCompletedEvents(): List<OutboxRecord> {
        return outboxRepository.findCompletedRecords()
    }

    fun getPartitionStats(): PartitionProcessingStats {
        return partitionMetricsProvider.getProcessingStats()
    }

    fun getClusterStats(): PartitionStats {
        return partitionMetricsProvider.getPartitionStats()
    }
}
```

## How It Works

### Outbox Pattern

1. **Transactional Write**: Events are saved to the outbox table in the same transaction as your domain changes
2. **Hash-based Partitioning**: Each event is assigned to a partition based on its aggregateId
3. **Instance Coordination**: Partitions are automatically distributed among active instances
4. **Background Processing**: A scheduler polls for unprocessed events in assigned partitions
5. **Ordered Processing**: Events are processed in creation order per aggregate
6. **Retry Logic**: Failed events are automatically retried with configurable policies

### Hash-based Partitioning

- **Consistent Hashing**: Each aggregate maps to the same partition using MurmurHash3
- **Fixed Partitions**: 256 partitions provide fine-grained load distribution
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Partitions are automatically redistributed when instances join/leave
- **Load Balancing**: Even distribution of partitions across all active instances

### Instance Coordination

- **Heartbeat System**: Instances send regular heartbeats to indicate they're alive
- **Automatic Discovery**: New instances are automatically detected and included
- **Failure Detection**: Stale instances are detected and their partitions redistributed
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Instances can shutdown gracefully, releasing their partitions

### Reliability Guarantees

‚úÖ **At-least-once delivery**: Events will be processed at least once  
‚úÖ **Ordering per aggregate**: Events for the same aggregate are processed in order  
‚úÖ **Failure recovery**: System failures don't result in lost events  
‚úÖ **Horizontal scalability**: Multiple instances process different partitions concurrently  
‚úÖ **Automatic rebalancing**: Partitions are redistributed when instances change

## Testing

The library is thoroughly tested with:

- **Unit Tests**: All components with high coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Real database and partitioning scenarios
- **Concurrency Tests**: Race condition validation
- **Performance Tests**: High-throughput scenarios

Run tests:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Migration from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

Version 0.2.0 introduces significant architectural improvements, transitioning from distributed locking to **hash-based partitioning** for better horizontal scaling and performance. This change requires database schema updates.

### Key Changes in 0.2.0

üéØ **Hash-based Partitioning**: Replaced distributed locking with partition-based coordination  
üìä **Instance Management**: New `outbox_instance` table for coordinating multiple instances  
üî¢ **Partition Field**: Added `partition` column to `outbox_record` table  
üìà **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized queries and improved throughput  
üìä **Built-in Metrics**: Comprehensive monitoring with partition-level visibility

### Database Schema Changes

The 0.2.0 release introduces:

1. **New `outbox_instance` table** for instance coordination
2. **New `partition` column** in `outbox_record` table
3. **Additional database indexes** for optimal performance
4. **Removal of lock-related tables** (if you used the distributed locking approach)

### Migration Steps

#### Option 1: Simple Migration (Recommended)

The **easiest and safest approach** is to drop existing outbox tables and let the library recreate them with the new schema:

```sql
-- Stop all application instances first
-- This ensures no events are being processed during migration

-- Drop existing tables (this will lose existing outbox data)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS outbox_record;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS outbox_lock;  -- If you have this from 0.1.0

-- Update your application to version 0.2.0
-- The new schema will be automatically created on startup if schema-initialization is enabled
```

**When to use this approach:**
- ‚úÖ You can afford to lose unprocessed outbox events
- ‚úÖ You're okay with a brief service interruption
- ‚úÖ You want the simplest migration path
- ‚úÖ You're in development or staging environment

#### Option 2: Data Preservation Migration

If you need to preserve existing outbox data, please **contact the maintainer** for assistance with a custom migration script. This requires:

- Migrating existing records to the new partition-based structure
- Calculating partition assignments for existing records
- Handling any failed or pending events appropriately

**When you need custom migration support:**
- üîÑ You have critical unprocessed events that must be preserved
- üè≠ You're migrating in a production environment with strict data requirements
- üìä You need to maintain event processing history

### Verification Steps

After migration, verify the setup:

1. **Check Tables**: Ensure `outbox_record` and `outbox_instance` tables exist
2. **Verify Partitioning**: Confirm that new records have `partition` values assigned
3. **Test Scaling**: Start multiple instances and verify partition assignment works
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Use the new metrics endpoints to monitor partition distribution

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed**: Distributed lock-based coordination
- **Changed**: `OutboxRecord` now includes partition information
- **New**: Instance coordination requires heartbeat mechanism
- **New**: Automatic partition assignment for horizontal scaling
